            DO NOT IMPORT THIS ONES 
    these urdfs are converted from the gui_utils of IsaacSim
    there are missing checkboxes that instead are available in headless mode

    to convert from urdf to usd look the "LAUNC_URDF_2_USD.txt" file in "assets" folder
    there is wrote the code to convert urdfs in the correct way
    look carefully where the .usd file is saved (spoiler: locally, in IsaacLab_ folder)

    the only problem with that method (and not the "gui" one) is that colors are not displayed
