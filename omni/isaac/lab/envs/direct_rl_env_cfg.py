    is_finite_horizon: bool = False

    Defaults to False, which means the task is treated as an infinite horizon problem.

    This flag handles the subtleties of finite and infinite horizon tasks:

    * **Finite horizon**: no penalty or bootstrapping value is required by the the agent for
      running out of time. However, the environment still needs to terminate the episode after the
      time limit is reached.
    * **Infinite horizon**: the agent needs to bootstrap the value of the state at the end of the episode.
      This is done by sending a time-limit (or truncated) done signal to the agent, which triggers this
      bootstrapping calculation.

    If True, then the environment is treated as a finite horizon problem and no time-out (or truncated) done signal
    is sent to the agent. If False, then the environment is treated as an infinite horizon problem and a time-out
    (or truncated) done signal is sent to the agent.

    Note:
        The base :class:`ManagerBasedRLEnv` class does not use this flag directly. It is used by the environment
        wrappers to determine what type of done signal to send to the corresponding learning agent.
