We would like to acknowledge The AI Institute's efforts in developing the Spot MDP from specifications provided by Boston Dynamics.
They trained, verified, and deployed the resulting policy on the Spot hardware and demonstrated its capability and reliability out in the real world.
The accompanying deployment code and access to Spot's low-level API will be available in the Spot RL Researcher Kit.

We thank The AI Institute for their trailblazing use of and contributions to Isaac Lab and for sharing their code publicly with the community to promote wider use of the Nvidia RL ecosystem.
