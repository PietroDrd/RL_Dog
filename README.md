# RL_Dog 
Reinforced-Learning for autonomous walking and suddenly-stopping of Legged Robot (AlienGO by Unitree)

Project by Pietro Dardano, advised by prof. [A. Del Prete](https://andreadelprete.github.io/) - UniTn - Summer 2024

## Methodology
- **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)** and **TODO: Constraints as Terminations (CAT)**: For detailed information on these methods, refer to the [research paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.18765).
- **Architecture Inspired by ANYmal (ETH-RSL)**: We modeled our architecture based on the principles outlined in the [ANYmal paper](https://www.science.org/doi/epdf/10.1126/scirobotics.aau5872).
- **SKRL**: We utilized the SKRL library to streamline our reinforcement learning implementations. More details can be found in the SKRL [documentation](https://skrl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro/getting_started.html).
- **Python + PyTorch**: Our primary programming languages and framework for development and deep learning.

## Setup
### Workstation

[![IsaacSim](https://img.shields.io/badge/IsaacSim-4.0-silver.svg)](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/isaacsim/latest/overview.html)
[![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.10-blue.svg)](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.10.html)
[![Linux platform](https://img.shields.io/badge/platform-linux--64-orange.svg)](https://releases.ubuntu.com/22.04/)
[![skrl](https://img.shields.io/badge/skrl-1.2.0-green.svg)](https://skrl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

- **NVIDIA's [Isaac Lab](https://isaac-sim.github.io/IsaacLab/)**:  provides the high-performance simulation environment necessary for training our models. Refer to the [Orbit](https://isaac-orbit.github.io/) and [Isaac Sim](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/isaacsim/latest/overview.html) pages for more information. <br>

#### Config: 
- CPU: AMDÂ® Ryzen 9 7950x
- GPU: 2x NVIDIA RTX A6000 Ada Generation, 48Gb GDDR6, 300W
- RAM: 192Gb
- OS: Ubuntu 22.04.4 LTS

Please note that IsaacLab contains many OpenAI Gym and Gymnasium features. It is common to find attributes, methods and classes related to them. <br>
It contains [RSL_RL](https://github.com/leggedrobotics/rsl_rl/tree/master) too, helpfull framework by ETH for legged robot training.

### Laptop (lower grade simulations)
**Remark**: for the time being i am mainly working on the Isaac Sim+Lab version for a more complete and realistic simulation. I'll try my best to implement it soon.

- **OpenAI Gymnasium**: Since Isaac Sim is almost not suitable for being installed on **laptops**, I opted for the lightweight Gymnasium as a simulation environment. It supports Python 3.10 and Ubuntu 22.04 and it's well documented. Obviously, it is far from a realistic simulation, as Isaac Sim is, but for quick tests and trainings, I consider it a good trade-off considering my hardware limitations. For more details on Gymnasium, visit the [official documentation](https://gymnasium.farama.org/).

### `Why not Isaac Gym?`: 
It requires Ubuntu 20.04 or earlier and Python 3.8 or 3.9. Having installed Ubuntu 22.04, I excluded this option. <br>
It is deprecated too, everyone now-a-day is transitioning to IsaacLab
